# Heart-stroke-prediction
Data Mining, Machine Learning and Python

This project aims to predict stroke occurrences in a given population, by analyzing the contributing factors. Also, it identifies the vulnerable population who are at higher risk.

<b>Why is it important for any of us to predict a heart stroke occurrence?</b><br>
Heart Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability across the world. Earlier detection will help us take preventive measures before it is too late. It will aid the health care professionals to focus on the people who are at higher stroke risk and focus on providing them with customized health care. <br>

**Dataset**<br>
Collected datasets related to heart health from different resources and merged them. After Merging the datasets, Features are selected based on feature importance and Domain knowledge.

**Data Mining and EDA**<br>
Data Mining techniques like feature engineering have been performed on the final datasets. Created 5 additional functionalities out of which 3 (Body_Weight, Sleep_Category, PhysicalActivity_SmokingStatus_Interaction) are derived directly from the dataset, and 2 new features (Comorbidity Score and Vulnerability) were formalized in an attempt to improve the predictive capacity of the models.

**Modelling**<br>
Preformed 3 models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes out of which Logist regression was considered as best model with 74% precision and 73%b accuracy in predicting the stroke occurrences.

**Community Contribution**<br>
This project contributes to public health by predicting the stroke occurrence in a group of individuals and it also identifies the vulnerable population.
